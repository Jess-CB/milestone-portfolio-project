            <h3> <a href="https://jess-cb.github.io/Rogue-Pickings/" target="_blank">Rogue Pickings</a> - HTML &amp; CSS Website From a Photoshop Design Comp</h3>
              <p>This project was completed for a HTML and CSS class I have been attending, however, we were only provided with a Photoshop design comp. From the comp I was able to produce this page, this showcases a culmination of my HTML and CSS skills that I have acquired and as you can see it looks great!</p>
            <h3> <a href="https://jess-cb.github.io/Jubilee-Austen/" target="_blank">Jubilee Austen</a> - HTML &amp; CSS Website</h3>
              <p>I completed this project also for my HTML and CSS course. The goal was to understand and apply HTML and CSS to a framework we had been supplied with, so as to produce clean and concise code.</p>

            <p>I love the  outdoors! Be it skiing in the winter, or mountain biking and hiking in the summer. I am at ease when Iâ€™m in mother nature's wonderland.</p>
